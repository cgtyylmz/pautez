Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a 2-pin (SWDIO/SWCLK) electrical alternative JTAG interface that has the same JTAG protocol on top.
SWD uses an ARM CPU standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5.
This enables the debugger to become another AMBA bus master for access to system memory and peripheral or debug registers.



The Debug Access Port (DAP) is split into two main control units. The Debug Port (DP) and the Access Port (AP),
and the physical connection to the debugger is part of the DP. The DAP supports two types of access,
Debug Port (DP) accesses and Access Port (AP) accesses. External device to communicate directly with Serial Wire Debug Port
(SW-DP) over SWDIO/SCLK pins. And SW-DP in turn can access one or several Access Ports (APs) the give access to the rest of
the system. The MEM-AP is important AP which provide a way to access all memory
and peripheral registers residing on the internal AHB/APB buses.
